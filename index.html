<body>

    <div class="container"></div>
    
    <!--This solution is less than ideal because we’re cluttering our HTML with JavaScript. Also, we can only have 1 “onclick” event per element.-->
    <button id="1st" onclick="alert('Hello, world!');">Click me</button>

    <!--This is a little better. We’ve moved the JS out of the HTML and into a JS file, but we still have the problem that a DOM element can only have 1 “onclick” property.-->
    <button id="btn">Click me too!</button>

    <!--Now, we maintain separation of concerns, and we also allow multiple event listeners if the need arises. Method 3 is much more flexible and powerful, though it is a bit more complex to set up.-->
    <button id="btn2">Click me too 2!</button>
